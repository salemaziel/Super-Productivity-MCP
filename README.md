<h1 align="center">Super Productivity MCP Server</h1>

<p align="center">
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI assistants to <a href="https://super-productivity.com">Super Productivity</a> — manage tasks, projects, and tags through Claude Desktop, Kiro, or any MCP-compatible client.
</p>

## What You Can Do

**✅ Quick Capture**
> "Add a task: Buy milk #shopping @tomorrow 15m"

Parses the tag, due date, and time estimate from short syntax — one shot, no follow-up needed.

**🧹 Batch Triage**
> "Show me all unscheduled tasks in my Work project, tag them #backlog, and set them due next Friday"

Filters, bulk-updates due dates, and adds tags — all in one conversation turn.

**🧠 Full Planning Session**
> "Look at my week: show today's plan and anything overdue. Break 'Launch blog' into subtasks, start the first one, and move anything I finished yesterday to done. Give me a time summary when you're done."

Reads resources for context, creates subtasks in batch, starts the timer, bulk-completes tasks, pulls the worklog, and summarizes — a multi-step workflow in a single prompt.

## SP Short Syntax

Include these in task titles and they are parsed automatically:

| Syntax | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `#tag` | `Buy milk #shopping` | Adds the "shopping" tag |
| `+project` | `Fix bug +work` | Assigns to "work" project (prefix match, min 3 chars) |
| `@due` | `Report @friday` | Sets due date to Friday |
| `@due time` | `Call @tomorrow 3pm` | Sets due date and time |
| `30m` | `Quick fix 30m` | Sets 30-minute time estimate |
| `1h/2h` | `Research 1h/2h` | Sets 1h spent, 2h estimate |

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not responding after install?** Toggle the plugin off and on in Settings → Plugins — this is a [known SP startup issue](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/7326).

**Commands timing out?** Ask *"Show debug info for Super Productivity"* to check that both sides are using the same data directory. Mac App Store users may need to set `SP_MCP_DATA_DIR`.

## Known Limitations

| Tool | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `plan_tasks_for_today` | Sets `plannedAt` on the task but does not add it to SP's internal Planner store, so the task may not appear in the Today view. | Upstream request: [super-productivity#7495](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/7495) |
