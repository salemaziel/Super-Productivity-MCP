<h1 align="center">Super Productivity MCP Server</h1>

<p align="center">
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI assistants to <a href="https://super-productivity.com">Super Productivity</a> — manage tasks, projects, and tags through Claude Desktop, Kiro, or any MCP-compatible client.
</p>

## What You Can Do

**✅ Quick Capture**
> "Add a task: Buy milk #shopping @tomorrow 15m"

Parses the tag, due date, and time estimate from short syntax — one shot, no follow-up needed.

**🧹 Batch Triage**
> "Show me all unscheduled tasks in my Work project, tag them #backlog, and set them due next Friday"

Filters, bulk-updates due dates, and adds tags — all in one conversation turn.

**🧠 Full Planning Session**
> "Look at my week: show today's plan and anything overdue. Break 'Launch blog' into subtasks, start the first one, and move anything I finished yesterday to done. Give me a time summary when you're done."

Reads resources for context, creates subtasks in batch, starts the timer, bulk-completes tasks, pulls the worklog, and summarizes — a multi-step workflow in a single prompt.

## Installation

### 1. Install the SP Plugin

**Option A — via npx:**
```bash
npx -y super-productivity-mcp@latest --extract-plugin
```

**Option B — manual download:**
Download `plugin.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/b0x42/Super-Productivity-MCP/releases/latest).

Then in Super Productivity: **Settings → Plugins → Upload Plugin**, select `plugin.zip`, restart SP.

> **SP ≥ 18.13.0:** After enabling the plugin, SP shows a one-time **Node execution consent dialog**. Click **Allow** — the plugin requires Node access to communicate with the MCP server. Consent persists per device; only re-asked if you re-upload the plugin.

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "super-productivity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "super-productivity-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Config file locations:
- **Claude Desktop (macOS):** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Desktop (Windows):** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

For **Claude Code**, don't edit the config file by hand — use the CLI:

```bash
# user scope (everywhere), project scope (-s project), or local scope (default)
claude mcp add -s user super-productivity npx -- -y super-productivity-mcp
```

To verify, run `claude mcp list`. Restart the session to load the server. Swap `npx -- -y super-productivity-mcp` for `super-productivity-mcp` (global install) or `node /absolute/path/to/dist/index.js` (from source) — see [Running without npx](#running-without-npx).

### 3. Verify

Ask your AI assistant: *"Check the Super Productivity connection"*

## Running without npx

`npx` is convenient but fetches the package on every cold cache and needs network access. If you'd rather pin a local copy, pick one of the options below.

### Option A — Global install

```bash
npm install -g super-productivity-mcp
super-productivity-mcp --extract-plugin   # optional: write plugin.zip to cwd
```

Then point your MCP client at the installed binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "super-productivity": {
      "command": "super-productivity-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

If the binary isn't found, your MCP client may not inherit your shell's `PATH`. Use the absolute path from `which super-productivity-mcp` as `command` — or, if `which` doesn't resolve it, point at `$(npm config get prefix)/bin/super-productivity-mcp` (on macOS/Linux).

### Option B — From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b0x42/Super-Productivity-MCP.git
cd Super-Productivity-MCP
npm install
npm run build              # produces dist/index.js and dist/plugin.zip
```

Then run the server directly with `node`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "super-productivity": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/Super-Productivity-MCP/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

The plugin to upload to Super Productivity is at `dist/plugin.zip` after `npm run build`.

## Prerequisites

- [Super Productivity](https://super-productivity.com) >= 14.0.0
- Node.js >= 18
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Kiro, etc.)

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |

| `check_connection` | Verify SP is running and the plugin is responding |
| `debug_directories` | Show resolved data directory paths |

## SP Short Syntax

Include these in task titles and they are parsed automatically:

| Syntax | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `#tag` | `Buy milk #shopping` | Adds the "shopping" tag |
| `+project` | `Fix bug +work` | Assigns to "work" project (prefix match, min 3 chars) |
| `@due` | `Report @friday` | Sets due date to Friday |
| `@due time` | `Call @tomorrow 3pm` | Sets due date and time |
| `30m` | `Quick fix 30m` | Sets 30-minute time estimate |
| `1h/2h` | `Research 1h/2h` | Sets 1h spent, 2h estimate |

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not loading?** Two common causes:
- **SP 18.6.0–18.9.x cold-boot race:** toggle the plugin off and on in Settings → Plugins (no restart needed on ≥ 18.6.0).
- **SP 18.10.0–18.12.x hard block:** update to SP ≥ 18.13.0. After re-uploading the plugin, accept the Node execution consent dialog that appears on first enable.

**Commands timing out?** Ask *"Show debug info for Super Productivity"* to check that both sides are using the same data directory. Mac App Store users may need to set `SP_MCP_DATA_DIR`.

## Known Limitations

| Tool | Issue | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `plan_tasks_for_today` | Sets `plannedAt` on the task but does not add it to SP's internal Planner store, so the task may not appear in the Today view. | Upstream request: [super-productivity#7495](https://github.com/super-productivity/super-productivity/issues/7495) |
